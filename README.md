## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app allows users to add daily weights and sends an sms to the user. It has the ability to store logins on the device.
## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
For this project I only built the login and the data entry screen. I aimed to keep the ui elements easily usable by the users and made the best use of all available screen estate.
## How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
I incrementally developed the app. I first planned the functionality, then built the UI and then coded the functionality. In the future I would definitely add tests.
## How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
I manually tested different functionality that my users might user in different ways to ensure nothing was broken. It revealed that when coding I may forget all usecases.
## Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
I had to innovate in the actual coding. Sometimes the tooling isn't as straighforward as you expect it to. For example when trying to check for sms permissions I was checking the wrong structure.
## In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I enjoyed all aspects of the development process. In addition to using my skills, the process also helped me learn and better myself.
